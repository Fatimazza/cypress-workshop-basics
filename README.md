> Basics of end-to-end testing with [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) test runner

## Requirements

- Any computer: Mac, Windows, Linux
- [Node 12.0.0+ (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com)

Check the Node version

```
$ node -v
# for example v14.17.1
$ npm -v
# for example 6.14.13
```

In order to get the code and install NPM dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bahmutov/cypress-workshop-basics.git
cd cypress-workshop-basics
npm install
```

If necessary, install dependencies inside TodoMVC folder

```bash
cd todomvc
npm install
```

### Quick check âœ…

You can test the installation by starting TodoMVC in the first terminal window

```shell
npm start
```

and you should see in the terminal

```text
> json-server --static . data.json --middlewares ./node_modules/json-server-reset


  \{^_^}/ hi!

  Loading data.json
  Loading ./node_modules/json-server-reset
  Done

  Resources
  http://localhost:3000/todos

  Home
  http://localhost:3000
```

If you open your browser and type "localhost:3000" you should see the web application running:

![TodoMVC application running in the browser](./img/app.png)

From the second terminal window you should be able to open Cypress in the root of the project with

```bash
$ npm run cy:open

> cypress-workshop-basics@1.0.0 cy:open /git/cypress-workshop-basics
> cypress open
```

### Tip

You can use the installed [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) utility to start the app, open Cypress and then shutdown the app when you exit Cypress.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Application

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) + REST server application that we are going to test is in the folder `todomvc`. This application and its full testing is described in [this blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2017/11/28/testing-vue-web-application-with-vuex-data-store-and-rest-backend/). The application should run fine without network access.

## Slides

The slides are deployed to GitHub Pages and can be seen at [https://glebbahmutov.com/cypress-workshop-basics/](https://glebbahmutov.com/cypress-workshop-basics/).

The slides can be seen locally by running `npm run slides` and opening `localhost:3100`. The content for the slides comes from the Markdown files in the [slides](./slides) folder. Read [Presentations with Reveal.js and Vite](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/reveal-vite/) for technical details.

## For self-guided learning

You can learn _everything_ in this repository without an instructor telling you what to do. Start the application, open Cypress, open the slides (see above), and follow the slides! Every section has learning objects, full set of instructions, and exercises to perform on your own.

There are even the answers, but you would not cheat by looking at them, would you?

## For speakers

This workshop can take all day, but you can pick the sections you are interested in teaching at will and customize it into any time duration. Everyone is coding for the most part, except for CI and the Cypress Dashboard sections, where the usage was shown via slides and actual sites.

During the workshop, keep the `todomvc` app running in one shell, while each section `01-basic`, `02-...`, `03-...` etc. has its own Cypress and specs subfolders `cypress/integration/...`. Usually a spec has several tests with placeholder comments. The workshop attendees are expected to make the tests pass using the knowledge from the slides and hints (and [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/)). Note that most folders have a prepared `spec.js` file and an `answer.js` file. The `answer.js` file is ignored by Cypress using a setting in `cypress.json`.

The only exception is the folder `00-start`. This is a folder for students to see how Cypress scaffolds example specs when you open Cypress for the very first time. In this folder students should execute...

```
cd 00-start
npm run cy:open
```

...and see the list of created example specs.

The slides are generated using [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) from Markdown sources in the [slides](slides) folder. You can show the slides locally by running

```shell
npm run slides
```

**Note:** always use relative paths to images from the slides Markdown, like
